# Context
This React template code is taken from codespaces in github. Only change present in App.jsx, go and see the file.

This repository is the creation of simple website using React Framework integration with FastAPI and PosgresSQL.

In this, we are uploading and retrieving images from fastapi and PosgresSQL. Only images are allowed.

After image is uploaded we will get image uploaded successfully response. While retrieving, we can't see the image in UI, but we can able to see the image in developer tool response.

This is done for basic upload and retrieval of images in posgresSQL.
